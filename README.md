## Description
Using NestJs as a Framework to developp the backend side of the application 
It offers a structural and standiarized tools to build robust APIs to manipulate data from our database.
I used Mongodb as a Database to store my data.

 You will find in src repo all the code of the backend side  | I divided the structure into 2 submodules  : 
 1- >> user repo for the authentification and autorization using Jwt/Passeport.
 2- >> companies repo to handle the CRUD operations used to create, edit, view, and delete companies.
